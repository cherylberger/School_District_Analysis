###  After identifying the potential for academic dishonesty in the 9th grade class at Thomas High School, the school board has informed (employer) that the recent School District Analysis must be revised to include only data that complies with the standards.  Therefore, the purpose of this PyCity Schools analysis is to repeat the distict level summary of reading and math scores as well as the more discreet school level summary of reading and math performance within the disctrict.  The students_complete.csv file will be scrubbed to remove the data for math and reading scores for all 9th grade students at Thomas high school and a new analysis will be provided containing a summary of the impact on the overall analysis with these changes. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
